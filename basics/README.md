# Shell scripting

- What are scripts

In laymans terms a script is a text file that inside of it we can write specific lines of codes in shell scripting language that the shell interprets and executes. There are 2 main requirements to using scripts.

1. The first line must begin with ```#!/bin/bash```
2. All your scripts must be executable. To make your file executable, use the ```chmod``` command: ```chmod u+x file```

- To execute a script we use the command ```./ script_name```

## Project Scripting
- In this project we were tasked to create scripts with different functionalities.

Each script serves a different purpose and will be documented in this README file with each linking to the GitHub file source.
